# bit64 4.5.99 (in development)

## NOTES

1. After creating, developing, and maintaining {bit64} for about 13 years, Jens Oehlschl√§gel has decided to step down as maintainer of the package. Michael Chirico will take over in this duty. Thank you Jens for creating such a wonderful & important part of the R ecosystem!

  I don't have any major plans for new features, and mostly hope to keep the package running and up to date. Contributors most welcome! I am also trying to freshen up the code base to make contribution easier.

1. The R version dependency has increased from 3.0.1 (May 2013) to 3.3.0 (April 2017). We plan to keep roughly the same R dependency as {data.table}, i.e., as old as possibly for as long as possible, with some bias towards gradually bringing in new R features to reduce the maintenance overhead of a growing nest of workarounds to keep the package "fresh" for users of the latest R versions.

# bit64 NEWS for versions 0.8-3 through 4.5.2 are now in [NEWS.0](https://github.com/r-lib/bit64/blob/master/NEWS.0)
